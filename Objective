Business Objectives
This company is the largest online loan marketplace facilitating personal loans, business loans, and the financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface.
Like most other lending companies, lending to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or absconds with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the biggest losses to lenders. In this case, customers labelled as ‘charged-off’ are the ‘defaulters’.
If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced, thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e., the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.
